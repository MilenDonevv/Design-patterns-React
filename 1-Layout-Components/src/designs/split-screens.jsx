/*


<div styles={...}>
    <h1>Component Code</h1> 
</div>


-----------

<div styles={...}>
    {children}
</div>

<>
    <h1>Component Code</h1>
</>

Separation between the component itself and where that component is being displayed on the page.

--> Components should't know where they're being displayed !! 

----------

npm install styled-components 

--> Very easy way to add styles to react components
